# OboeAudioRecorder

I created this project some days ago, in order to get skills in Android JNI/NDK/C++ and Google Oboe library.

On 3rd of July 2020, it records audio to a buffer in memory.

The next step will be to save these audio data in a file on the Android device.

On 5th of July 2020, it records the audio to a .wav file on the Android device (in the "Recorders" folder).
